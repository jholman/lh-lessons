Expressions, Assignment, Etc
============================

This is a note about a few fundamental concepts in Ruby.  I'll discuss
_expressions_ vs _statements_, _values_ vs _returning_ vs _output_, and _assignment_ vs _equality testing_.
The note is a little picky about terminology, but it's not super important to know the terminology
(although it certainly doesn't hurt, especially in an interview).  But it is super important
to know the concepts here, and I don't know how to explain them without being picky about
terminology.



Expressions and Statements
--------------------------

In Ruby (and almost all other languages), there are _expressions_.
A programming expression is a lot like a math expression, like `2+2` or `(1+2)*3`.
Note that the `+` and the `*` are _operators_ (in both math and in programming).
