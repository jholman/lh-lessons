# LHL-on-Windows : Vagrant

## Introduction

This file attempts to plan and document a strategy for doing the LHL curriculum on a Windows computer.  This is one of multiple approaches I am documenting.

In this approach, we try to install and use Vagrant and VBox, as similarly to the main curriculum instruction as we can.

### Expected hurdles

* `PATH` problems (preventing us from just opening a prompt and typing `vagrant`
* `PATH` problems (preventing vagrant from finding `ssh`)
* filesystem challenges with the linux/windows shared directory
